### Background on my Dataset


The dataset I plan to analyze further is the Wine Quality dataset. I donâ€™t have a background in winemaking, but I believe that by researching and interpreting the provided data, along with its descriptions, I can properly understand and assess it.

According to the original data source (Kaggle), this dataset focuses on determining wine quality, specifically for various Portuguese red wines under the "Vinho Verde" label. It captures chemical properties of these wines and assigns quality labels accordingly.

One key aspect of winemaking is fermentation, where yeast breaks down sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The amount of residual sugar left in the wine can indicate how effective the fermentation process was.

Another impactful characteristic seems to be sulfur dioxide, which can influence yeast activity during fermentation. As a result, there can be a wide range of variations to the final product changing the quality. Additionally, according to UBC, some individuals may experience adverse reactions to sulfur dioxide (e.g., nausea, hives), making it a factor that could contribute to wine quality variability.

5. **Preprocessing**:

    5.1 For numerical features, determine the best transformation to use. Indicate e transformation that seems appropriate and why. Include the code illustrating how  apply the transformation. For at least one attribute, show the distribution before d after the transformation. See [Preprocessing data](https://scikit-learn.org/able/modules/preprocessing.html).

    5.2 For categorical features, show how to apply [one-hot encoding](https://ikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html).  your dataset does not have categorical data, show how to apply the one-hot encoder  the label (target variable).

I think standardizing my data is good choice for preprocessing. Even though my data is pretty clean, the different attributes are along different scales. This is important because it can affect any modelling algorithms, as they are sensitive to different scales of magnitude.
